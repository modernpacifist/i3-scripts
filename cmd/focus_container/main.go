func main() {
	// TODO: the story is that if the floating container is not focused which is called with the mark
	// then focus it with i3.RunCommand
	// if its focused and the mark is called again then hide it

	// this will remove the need to press call this functionality twice

	// if user is focused on tiling container then just hide the floating container
	// chosen by the mark
